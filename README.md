# EVER/IP(R)
The Elastic Versatile Encrypted Relay for IP (EVER/IP) Networking Suite

## What is EVER/IP?

EVER/IP is a new way to think about building the Internet. When the Internet was first developed in the 1980s, there was limited computational power to route millions of messages per second. The solution that the godfathers of the Internet introduced was a prefix-based memory-bound routing table design that requires very expensive custom ASIC and memory to operate at scale.

Fast-forward three decades, EVER/IP is the first kind of routing software that does not require memory expensive routing tables, but instead uses the CPU to calculate forwarding direction based entirely on local information.

Being entirely local information driven, there is no need for expensive ISPs and Providers, thus reducing the cost of communication for people and things alike.

Thanks in part to the iPhone(r)<sup>(1)</sup> and other smartphones of its generation, the computing power that we have in our pocket is incredible. EVER/IP aims to unleash this power, bringing-down the cost of communications worldwide and beyond. 

Microsoft helped take us from the mainframe era with micro-software. We aim to take humanity into an era from Internet eXchanges to Micro Internet eXchanges (MIXes). Welcome to the MicroISP™ era.
